# FourierRollerCoaster
Calculus III Rollercoaster Design Project. 

Step 1.) Create a set of points in 3d space that align with the general shape of the rollercoaster you desire. Format should be in a CSV document with  columns (t, x, y, z).
Step 2.) Plug the CSV document into the start of the function to find the equations for each parameterized axis (x, y, z)
Step 3.) Use a plotting tool to examine your rollercoaster in 3d space and verify.
